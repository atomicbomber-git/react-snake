# A Web App

## Description
Clone of the [Snake game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_(video_game)) using the [React](https://reactjs.org/) front-end library, written in [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and bundled using [parcel](https://parceljs.org/).

## Compilation
Compilation from source code requires the Yarn package manager or Node Package Manager (NPM) installed in your machine.
To compile, first issue the command `yarn install` to install required dependencies. After the dependencies have been installed, you can try the program in development mode by running `yarn start` and opening `http://localhost:1234` through the browser. You can also build it in production mode (which runs faster), using `yarn build`. The built `html` and `js` files are in the `/docs` directory.
